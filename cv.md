## About me:
Hello! My name is Alexandr. I live in the city of Minsk  and I am 30 years old. 
I became interested in programming a year and a half ago. Started with courses for beginners in HTML and CSS.
Since I started to succeed, I decided to further develop in this direction and, on the advice of a friend, ended up on the RS School course ☑️
On the course, I hope to get the maximum amount of knowledge and practice in JS and front-end development.
