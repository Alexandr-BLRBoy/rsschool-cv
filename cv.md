## About me:
___
Hello! My name is Alexandr. I live in the city of Minsk  and I am 30 years old. 
I became interested in programming a year and a half ago. Started with courses for beginners in HTML and CSS.
Since I started to succeed, I decided to further develop in this direction and, on the advice of a friend, ended up on the RS School course ☑️
On the course, I hope to get the maximum amount of knowledge and practice in JS and front-end development.

## My skill:
___
* HTML
* CSS
* Mac iOS

## My code example:
___
function evenOrOdd(number) {
    let result = '';
    let num = number;
    if (num % 2 === 0){
        result = 'Even';
    } else {
        result = 'Odd';
    }
    return result
    }

## Work experience 🧑‍💻 :
